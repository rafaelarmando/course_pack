# Data-Analysis
Project 4

### Goal
The purpose of this project is to give you an opportunity to work on a full data analysis. You will perform a complete tidying, summary and visualization on a [dataset](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/https-medium-freecodecamp-org-best-free-open-data-sources-anyone-can-use-a65b514b0f2d/) of your choice. The data set should have at least 5,000 observations and 5 variables, but the choice is up to you.

### Deadlines
Friday, Dec 4: Meet with teacher to discuss your choice of dataset.

Wednesday, Dec 9: Meet with teacher to discuss progress. **(QUIZ GRADE)**

Wednesday, Dec 16: Project due.

### Instructions
This project is open-ended; there are no wrong answers, but there is a clear path you must follow to complete your project successfully.

You have been provided with two files: **Analysis.Rmd** and **Presentation.Rmd**. 

You are expected to do all your work inside the **Analysis.Rmd** file; this includes all your wrangling, summarizing, visualizing, and exploring work.

In the beginning, you might not know exactly what questions you'd like to answer, but you can follow the path below to help you get started. 

**Visualize** your dataset: Create a few preliminary plots to help you gain an understanding of your data.

**Transform** your dataset: Consider *filter*ing your dataset a few times so you can focus on different subsets of your data. Use *mutate* or *summarize* to add new variables to your dataset computed from existing values. Follow this with new visualizations to gain a deeper understanding of your dataset and start asking questions.

**Explore** your dataset: Investigate the *variation* and *covariation* in your dataset. 

**Present** your findings: Use the **Presentation.Rmd** file to create a slide show summarizing your findings.
